        // and replace it with some structured equivalent. [Hint: The break statement exits a loop from the
        // body of the loop. The other way to exit is by failing the loop-continuation test. Consider using in
        // the loop-continuation test a second test that indicates “early exit because of a ‘break’ condition.”]

        // Fig. 5.13.
